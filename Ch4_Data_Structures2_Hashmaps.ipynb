    "So, instead of of using the key as an array index directly, the array index is computed by applying the hash function to the key. It makes it very fast to access an element from any index from the hash table. The hash table uses the hashing function to compute the index of where the data item should be stored in the hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "While looking up an element in the hash table, hashing of the key gives the index of the corresponding record in the table. Ideally, the hash function assigns a unique value to each of the keys; however, in practice, we may get hash collisions where the hash function generates the same index for more than one key.\n",

    "- choose a hash function $h$ that maps each key $k$ to an integer $h(k)$\n",

    "- the list is called a **hash table**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing uses a hash function to map the keys to another range of data in a way that a new range of keys can be used as an index in the hash table; in other words, hashing is used to convert the key values to integer values, which can be used as an index in the hash table.\n",

    "But there are some requirements for a hash function: \n",
    "- It needs to be consistent. For example, suppose you put in “apple” and get back “4”. Every time you put in “apple”, you should get “4” back. Without this, your hash table won’t work. \n",

    "Arrays and lists map straight to memory, but hash tables are smarter. They use a hash function to intelligently figure out where to store elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash tables are a data structure be er suited to this kind of problem. A hash table is a data structure where elements are accessed by a keyword rather than an index number, unlike in lists and arrays. \n",
    "A hash table uses a hashing function in order to find an index position where an element should be stored and retrieved.\n",

    "\n",
    "If we try to develop a hash function that avoids collisions, this becomes very slow, and a slow hash function does not serve the purpose of the hash table.

    "The queue data structure is very similar to the regular queue you are accustomed to in real life. It is just like a line of people waiting to be served in sequential order at a shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "A queue works as follows. The first person to join the queue usually gets served first, and everyone will be served in the order in which they joined the queue. The acronym FIFO best explains the concept of a queue. FIFO stands for first in, first out. When people are standing in a queue waiting for their turn to be served, service is only rendered at the front of the queue. Therefore, people are dequeued from the front of the queue and enqueued from the back where they wait their turn. The only time people exit the queue is when they have been served, which only occurs at the very front of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To join the queue, participants must stand behind the last person in the queue. This is the only legal or permitted way the queue accepts new entrants. The length of the queue does not matter. \n",

    "1. Data elements can only be inserted from one end, the rear end/tail of the queue. \n",
    "2. Data elements can only be deleted from the other end, the front/head of the queue. \n",
    "3. Only data elements from the front of the queue can be read\n",
    "\n",
    "The operation to add an element to the queue is known as **enqueue**. Deleting an element from the queue uses the **dequeue** operation. \n",
    "Whenever an element is enqueued, the length or size of the queue increments by 1, and dequeuing an item reduces the number of elements in the queue by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The enqueue operation will be performed **only at the tail/rear end** and the dequeue operation will be performed **from the head/front end**. \n",
    "It should be fixed that one end will be used for enqueue operations and the other end will be used for dequeue operations; however, either end can be used for each of these operations. It is good in general practice to fix that we perform enqueue operations from the rear end and dequeue operations from the front end.\n",
