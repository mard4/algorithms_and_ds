    "\n",
    "A tree is a hierarchical form of data structure. Data structures such as lists, queues, and stacks are linear in that the items are stored in a sequential way. However, a tree is a non-linear data structure, as there is a parent-child relationship between the items.\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear data structures, data items are stored in sequential order, whereas non-linear data structures store data items in a non-linear order, where a data item can be connected to more than one other data item.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top of the tree’s data structure is known as a root node. This is the ancestor of all other nodes in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"./img/80.png\" width=\"500\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of terms associated with a tree: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Node**: Each circled letter in the preceding diagram represents a node. A node is any data structure that stores data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Root node**: The root node is the first node from which all other nodes in the tree descend from. In other words, a root node is a node that does not have a parent node. In every tree, there is always one unique root node. The root node is node A in the above example tree. \n",
    "- **Subtree**: A subtree is a tree whose nodes descend from some other tree. For example, nodes F, K, and L form a subtree of the original tree. \n",
    "- **Degree**: The total number of children of a given node is called the degree of the node. A tree consisting of only one node has a degree of 0. The degree of node A in the preceding diagram is 2, the degree of node B is 3, the degree of node C is 3, and, the degree of node G is 1. \n",
    "- **Leaf node**: The leaf node does not have any children and is the terminal node of the given tree. The degree of the leaf node is always 0. In the preceding diagram, the nodes J, E, K, L, H, M, and I are all leaf nodes. \n",
    "- **Edge**: The connection among any given two nodes in the tree is called an edge. The total number of edges in a given tree will be a maximum of one less than the total nodes in the tree. An example edge is shown in Figure 6.1. \n",
    "- **Parent**: A node that has a subtree is the parent node of that subtree. For example, node B is the parent of nodes D, E and F , and node F is the parent of nodes K and L. \n",
    "- **Child**: This is a node that is descendant from a parent node. For example, nodes B and C are children of parent node A , while nodes H, G and I are the children of parent node C. \n",
    "- **Sibling**: All nodes with the same parent node are siblings. For example, node B is the sibling of node C, similarly, nodes D,E and F are also siblings.\n",
    "- **Level**: The root node of the tree is considered to be at level 0. The children of the root node are considered to be at level 1, and the children of the nodes at level 1 are considered to be at level 2, and so on. For example, in Figure 6.1, root node A is at level 0, nodes B and C are at level 1, and nodes from D to I are at level 2. \n",
    "- **Height of a tree**: The total number of nodes in the longest path of the tree is the height of the tree. For example, in Figure 6.1, the height of the tree is 4, as the longest paths, A - B - D - J , A - C - G - M , and A - B - F - K , all have a total number of four nodes each. \n",
    "- **Depth**: The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root of the tree to that node. In the preceding tree example, the depth of node H is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a tree data structure, the nodes are arranged in a parent-child relationship. There should not be any cycle among the nodes in trees. The tree structure has nodes to form a hierarchy, and a tree that has no nodes is called an empty tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fig 6.1 $\\to$ Height = 4, Depth = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<u> Properties </u>\n",
    "- The **root** is the top level of the tree and is connected to one or more other nodes.\n",
    "- If a node is connected to another node via an edge, then it is said to be the **parent** of the node (and that node is the child of the another node)\n",
    "- Any node can be *parent* of one or more nodes.\n",
    "- *All nodes have at most one parent*\n",
    "- The *root* is the *only node* that *does not have any parent*\n",
    "- Some nodes do not have children, they are called **leaves**\n",
