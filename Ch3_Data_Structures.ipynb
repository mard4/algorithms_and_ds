    "## <center><b> Dynamic Vectors </b></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the term \"dynamic vectors\" is often used in the context of dynamic arrays or lists. Unlike traditional arrays in some other programming languages, Python lists are dynamic arrays, meaning that they can resize themselves automatically as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some characteristics of dynamic vectors (Python lists):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Sizing:**\n",
    "   - Lists in Python can grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed.\n",
    "   - This dynamic resizing is handled by the Python interpreter, making it convenient for the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory Management:**\n",
    "   - Python lists are implemented as dynamic arrays under the hood.\n",
    "   - When a list is created, an initial amount of memory is allocated. If the list grows beyond this initial allocation, additional memory is allocated automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexible Data Types:**\n",
    "   - Python lists can hold elements of different data types.\n",
    "   - You can have a mix of integers, floats, strings, or other Python objects in the same list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mutable:**\n",
    "   - Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their elements in place. You can change, add, or remove elements without creating a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Indexing and Slicing:**\n",
    "   - Elements in a list can be accessed using indices, and you can use slicing to extract portions of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of a dynamic vector (Python list) and its basic operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a dynamic vector (list)\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding elements\n",
    "my_list.append(4)\n",
    "my_list.extend([5, 6])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modifying elements\n",
    "my_list[0] = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Removing elements\n",
    "my_list.pop(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Printing the resulting list\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [0, 2, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `my_list` is a dynamic vector that can be modified by adding, modifying, or removing elements. The list grows or shrinks dynamically as operations are performed on it."
