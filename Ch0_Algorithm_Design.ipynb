    "## <center><b> Computing the running time complexity of an algorithm </b></center>\n",
    "Computing the running time complexity of an algorithm involves analyzing how the algorithm's running time grows with respect to the size of its input. The goal is to express this relationship using big O notation, which describes the upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's running time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the general steps for computing the time complexity of an algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the Basic Operations:**\n",
    "   - Determine the fundamental operations that contribute the most to the running time.\n",
    "   - These operations are usually the dominant factors in the algorithm's time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Count the Operations:**\n",
    "   - Analyze how many times each basic operation is executed in terms of the input size.\n",
    "   - Express this count as a function of the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simplify the Expression:**\n",
    "   - Simplify the expression obtained in the previous step by focusing on the most significant terms.\n",
    "   - Drop lower-order terms and constant factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Express in Big O Notation:**\n",
    "   - Use big O notation to describe the upper bound of the simplified expression.\n",
    "   - The result is often written in the form $O(f(n))$, where $f(n)$ is a function representing the growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example to illustrate the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def exampleAlgorithm(arr):\n",
    "    # Basic operation: Comparison in a loop\n",
    "    for i in range(len(arr)):\n",
    "        for j in range(len(arr)):\n",
    "            if arr[i] < arr[j]:\n",
    "                # Basic operation: Swap elements\n",
    "                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time complexity analysis:\n",
    "# - Two nested loops, each of size n (where n is the length of the input array).\n",
    "# - Inside the inner loop, there is a constant-time operation (swap).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Counting operations: O(n^2) comparisons + O(n^2) swaps\n",
    "# Simplify: O(n^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time complexity: O(n^2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the size of the input array. The nested loops contribute to the quadratic growth in the running time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the time complexity analysis provides an upper bound on the growth rate, and the actual running time might be better than the worst-case scenario predicted by big O notation. Additionally, constant factors and lower-order terms are often ignored in big O notation, focusing on the dominant factors that determine the growth rate."
