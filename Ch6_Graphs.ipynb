    "Graphs are a non-linear data structure, in which the problem is represented as a network by connecting a set of nodes with edges, like a telephone network or social network. For example, in a graph, nodes can represent different cities while the links between them represent edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is a set of a finite number of vertices (also known as nodes) and edges, in which the edges are the links between vertices, and each edge in a graph joins two distinct nodes. Moreover, a graph is a formal mathematical representation of a network, i.e. a graph G is an ordered pair of a set V of vertices and a set E of edges, given as $G = (V, E)$\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Edge**: This is a connection between two vertices. The line connecting A and B is an example of an edge. \n",
    "- **Loop**: When an edge from a node is returned to itself , that edge forms a loop, e.g. D node. \n",
    "- **Degree of a vertex/node**: The total number of edges that are incidental on a given vertex is called the degree of that vertex. For example, the degree of the B vertex in the previous diagram is 4 . \n",
    "- **Adjacency**: This refers to the connection(s) between any two nodes; thus, if there is a connection between any two vertices or nodes, then they are said to be adjacent to each other. For example, the C node is adjacent to the A node because there is an edge between them. \n",
    "- **Path**: A sequence of vertices and edges between any two nodes represents a path. For example, CABE represents a path from the C node to the E node. \n",
    "- **Leaf vertex (also called pendant vertex)**: A vertex or node is called a leaf vertex or pendant vertex if it has exactly one degree.\n",

    "Topological sorting is an ordering of the vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge `(u, v)`, vertex `u` comes before vertex `v` in the ordering. In simpler terms, it's a linear ordering of the vertices that respects the partial order defined by the edges in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key points about topological sorting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):** Topological sorting is defined only for directed graphs that do not contain cycles. If the graph has a cycle, it is not possible to find a topological ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Applications:**\n",
    "    - **Task Scheduling:** Topological sorting is commonly used in project management and scheduling. Vertices represent tasks, and directed edges represent dependencies between tasks.\n",
    "    - **Compiler Design:** In compiler optimization, topological sorting is used for register allocation and instruction scheduling.\n",
    "    - **Dependency Resolution:** In software development, it can be used to determine the order in which modules or components should be built or executed based on their dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Algorithm:**\n",
    "   - A common algorithm for topological sorting is based on Depth-First Search (DFS). The idea is to perform a DFS traversal of the graph and assign a post-order number to each vertex. The vertices are then ordered in decreasing order of their post-order numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Here's a high-level overview of the algorithm:\n",
    "      1. Start DFS from any unvisited vertex.\n",
    "      2. During the DFS traversal, assign post-order numbers to the vertices.\n",
    "      3. Once the DFS traversal is complete, order the vertices based on their post-order numbers in decreasing order.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The result is a topological ordering of the vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pseudocode:**\n",
    "    ```plaintext\n",
    "    TopologicalSort(graph):\n",
    "        1. Mark all vertices as not visited.\n",
    "        2. Initialize an empty stack to store the result.\n",
    "        3. Perform DFS from every unvisited vertex.\n",
    "        4. During DFS, push each vertex onto the stack after visiting all its adjacent vertices.\n",
    "        5. The result is obtained by popping vertices from the stack.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Example:**\n",
    "   Let's consider a simple example. Suppose we have the following directed graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   5 --> 0 <-- 4\n",
