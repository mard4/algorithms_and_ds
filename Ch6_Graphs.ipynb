    "Graphs are a non-linear data structure, in which the problem is represented as a network by connecting a set of nodes with edges, like a telephone network or social network. For example, in a graph, nodes can represent different cities while the links between them represent edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is a set of a finite number of vertices (also known as nodes) and edges, in which the edges are the links between vertices, and each edge in a graph joins two distinct nodes. Moreover, a graph is a formal mathematical representation of a network, i.e. a graph G is an ordered pair of a set V of vertices and a set E of edges, given as $G = (V, E)$\n",

    "- **Node or vertex**: A point or node in a graph is called a vertex. In the preceding diagram, the vertices or nodes are A, B, C, D, and E and are denoted by a dot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Edge**: This is a connection between two vertices. The line connecting A and B is an example of an edge. \n",
    "- **Loop**: When an edge from a node is returned to itself , that edge forms a loop, e.g. D node. \n",
    "- **Degree of a vertex/node**: The total number of edges that are incidental on a given vertex is called the degree of that vertex. For example, the degree of the B vertex in the previous diagram is 4 . \n",
    "- **Adjacency**: This refers to the connection(s) between any two nodes; thus, if there is a connection between any two vertices or nodes, then they are said to be adjacent to each other. For example, the C node is adjacent to the A node because there is an edge between them. \n",
    "- **Path**: A sequence of vertices and edges between any two nodes represents a path. For example, CABE represents a path from the C node to the E node. \n",
    "- **Leaf vertex (also called pendant vertex)**: A vertex or node is called a leaf vertex or pendant vertex if it has exactly one degree.\n",
    "- **Diameter**: of a graph, is the maximum of the distance between any two pair of nodes in the graph\n",
    "- **Distance**: is the smallest number of steps needed to reach one from the other in the graph\n",

    "An **undirected graph** simply represents edges as lines between the nodes. \n",
    "There is no additional information about the relationship between the nodes, other than the fact that they are connected.\n",

    "For **directed graphs**, the arrow of an edge determines the flow of direction.\n",

    "A graph representation technique means how we store the graph in memory, i.e., how we store the vertices, edges, and weights (if the graph is a weighted graph). Graphs can be represented with two methods, i.e. (1) an **adjacency list** based on a linked list, and (2) an **adjacency matrix**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An adjacency list representation is based on a linked list. In this, we represent the graph by maintaining a list of neighbors (also called a adjacent node) for every vertex (or node) of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In an adjacency matrix representation of a graph, we maintain a matrix that represents which node is adjacent to which other node in the graph; i.e., the adjacency matrix has the information of every edge in the graph, which is represented by cells of the matrix.\n",

    "An adjacency list is preferable when we expect that the graph is going to be sparse and we will have a smaller number of edges;\n",
