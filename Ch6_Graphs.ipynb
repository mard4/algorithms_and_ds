    "Graphs are a non-linear data structure, in which the problem is represented as a network by connecting a set of nodes with edges, like a telephone network or social network. For example, in a graph, nodes can represent different cities while the links between them represent edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is a set of a finite number of vertices (also known as nodes) and edges, in which the edges are the links between vertices, and each edge in a graph joins two distinct nodes. Moreover, a graph is a formal mathematical representation of a network, i.e. a graph G is an ordered pair of a set V of vertices and a set E of edges, given as $G = (V, E)$\n",

    "- **Node or vertex**: A point or node in a graph is called a vertex. In the preceding diagram, the vertices or nodes are A, B, C, D, and E and are denoted by a dot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Edge**: This is a connection between two vertices. The line connecting A and B is an example of an edge. \n",
    "- **Loop**: When an edge from a node is returned to itself , that edge forms a loop, e.g. D node. \n",
    "- **Degree of a vertex/node**: The total number of edges that are incidental on a given vertex is called the degree of that vertex. For example, the degree of the B vertex in the previous diagram is 4 . \n",
    "- **Adjacency**: This refers to the connection(s) between any two nodes; thus, if there is a connection between any two vertices or nodes, then they are said to be adjacent to each other. For example, the C node is adjacent to the A node because there is an edge between them. \n",
    "- **Path**: A sequence of vertices and edges between any two nodes represents a path. For example, CABE represents a path from the C node to the E node. \n",
    "- **Leaf vertex (also called pendant vertex)**: A vertex or node is called a leaf vertex or pendant vertex if it has exactly one degree.\n",
